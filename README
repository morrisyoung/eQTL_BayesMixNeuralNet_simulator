We will simulate according to exactly the neural model assumed (the mixed-layered network model).

This simulator is only used for testing the training code (training algorithm, specifically, the stochastic gradient descent used in the mixed-layered neural network model). This simulator is not simulating the true underlying biological mechanism.
